### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- Added mechanism to migrate registry contents from s3 to a persistent volume. Note that this cannot be triggered yet, but will later be used once all object storage-related migrations are available.

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Added [KOTS add-on](/docs/add-ons/kotsadm) version 1.56.0.
- Reverted changes to https://kurl.sh/latest that were introduced in [v2021.11.04-0](/release-notes/v2021.11.04-0). As a result, Rook and Kubernetes 1.19 are once again in the default configuration.
