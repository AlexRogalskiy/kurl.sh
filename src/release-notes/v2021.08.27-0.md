### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- Clusters with containerd enabled will be automatically migrated from docker when docker is detected. Previously containerd would not be installed when docker was detected.

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fixed an issue that prevented the [internal load balancer](/docs/add-ons/ekco#internal-load-balancer) from being started on remote nodes when not explicitly enabled.
- Fixed an issue that could cause the [minio add-on](/docs/add-ons/minio) to wait forever when creating a PVC.
