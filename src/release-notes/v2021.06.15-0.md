### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- Added [KOTS add-on](/docs/add-ons/kotsadm) version 1.44.1
- Added a new field, kurl.InstallerVersion, that allows [pinning the kURL installer version](https://staging.kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/#versioned-releases).

### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- EKCO will reschedule all pods with PVCs prior to rebooting a node.
- Containerd configuration will be regenerated when rerunning the installer. New settings have been added to the [Containerd add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/containerd) to allow you to preserve the existing config or to add additional fields.
