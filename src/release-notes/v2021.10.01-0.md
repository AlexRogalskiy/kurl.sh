### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- When using Longhorn in an installer spec without an object store (i.e. Minio), the [Registry addon](/docs/add-ons/registry) will be deployed with two replicas and a ReadWriteMany (RWX) volume for greater availability.
- Containerd is now the default Container Runtime Interface (CRI). For upgrades to existing installations, migrations from Docker, the previous default CRI, to containerd will occur automatically unless Docker is changed in the specification prior to upgrading. 
_**NOTE:**_ This change may impact any Docker CLI scripts if Docker is currently in use and should be considered before upgrading.  
### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fixed a bug to allow User and Service Account token authenticate to the API
