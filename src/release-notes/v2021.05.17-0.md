### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- The following improvements have been made to prompts requiring user feedback:
  - For interactive terminal sessions, all prompts will no longer timeout.
  - For non-interactive terminal sessions, all prompts that require user input will now fail.
  - For non-interactive terminal sessions, confirmation prompts will now automatically confirm or deny based on the default.
  - Preflight failures and warnings will no longer prompt to confirm or deny, and instead will continue.
  - Properties [`spec.kurl.ignoreRemoteLoadImagesPrompt`](https://staging.kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options) and [`spec.kurl.ignoreRemoteUpgradePrompt`](https://staging.kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options) have been added to the `kurl.sh/v1beta1.Installer` spec to bypass prompts for automation purposes.

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fixed an issue that could cause the node ready check to falsely report as successful causing unforseen issues with an installation.
