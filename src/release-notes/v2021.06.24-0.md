### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- 

### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- Host packages installed on CentOS, RHEL and Oracle Linux will now be installed using yum rather than rpm and no longer force overwrite previously installed versions.
- The Prometheus addon will now pass the flag [--storage.tsdb.retention.size=9GB](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects) to avoid filling the PVC completely. (Version 0.48.1-16.10.0+)

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fixed a bug with the `kurl-registry-ip` flag that caused errors when restoring airgap clusters while using the Containerd addon.
