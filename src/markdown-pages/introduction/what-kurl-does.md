## Kubeadm Pre-Init
Kubernetes has a few prerequisites that are outside of the scope of the kubeadm installer. For example, Docker (or another container runtime) must be present before running kubeadm. The kURL installer provides a declarative way to package a Docker installation (again, for both online and airgapped environments) along with advanced Docker Engine configuration options.

kURL will perform the following steps on the host prior to delegating to `kubeadm init`.

* Check OS compatibility
* Check Docker compatibility if pre-installed
* Disable swap
* Check SELinux
* Install Docker
* Install Kubeadm, Kubelet, Kubectl and CNI packages
* Generate Kubeadm config files from flags passed to the script
* Load kernel modules required for running Kube-proxy in IPVS mode
* Configure Docker and Kubernetes to work behind a proxy if detected

## After kubeadm (Adding Add-Ons)
Once kubeadm gets the cluster running, itâ€™s not ready for an application yet. A cluster will need networking, storage and more. These services are provided by other other open source components, including a lot of the CNCF ecosystem. In a kURL installation manifest, you can specify the additional add-ons that are installed after kubectl starts the cluster. For example, you can include Calico for a CNI plugin, Rook for distributed storage, Prometheus for monitoring and Fluentd for log aggregation. In addition to specifying the add-ons and versions, most add-ons include advanced options that allow you to specify the initial configuration.

After `kubeadm init` has brought up the Kubernetes control plane, kURL will install add-ons into the cluster.
The available add-ons are:

* [Weave](https://www.weave.works/oss/net/)
* [Rook](https://rook.io/)
* [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/)
* [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/)
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
* [Nodeless](https://www.elotl.co/)
* [Calico](https://www.projectcalico.org/)
* AWS (enables the AWS cloud provider in Kubernetes)
